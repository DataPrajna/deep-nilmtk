# deep-nilmtk
This repository documents codes written in python for disaggregation of appliance signatures. Deep convolutional neural network using the package "Tensor Flow" is implemented to classify appliance signatures. In  addition to packages available in python, we have installed  the nilmtk (Non Intrusive Load  Monitoring Tool Kit) package, https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk, for the data and custom package required to classify appliance signatures. 

This is a work in progress,  changes are committed as we are improving the Deep Convolutional Neural Nework Algorithm.
